# Personal Wiki
A Personal wiki built using MediaWiki and MariaDB containers
Pre-requisites - Docker

A backup of MariaDB volume is created and stored as an image on DockerHub - https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/manojjawalkar/personal-wiki
To create the backup I have used DockerDesktop's "Volumes Backup & Share" extension. Find more details here - https://hub.docker.com/extensions/docker/volumes-backup-extension
